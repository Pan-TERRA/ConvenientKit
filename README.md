#  Convenient Kit

 Simple universal drop-in library, which is designed to facilitate the use of many default objects from Foundation and UIKit. Originally it was designed for personal use, but then it was decided to put it in the open source to simplify coding for yourself and everyone else.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:
